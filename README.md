# Perceptron_Algorithm_and_Support_Vector_Machine
This program simulates the perceptron algorithm and support vector machine in finding the target line that classifies the sample points. We randomly selected 100 points to be the training set and two points to construct the target line. At the end, the error of the two solutions are measured using 100000 random test points.
